# Description

RoboticsXR is an extended reality framework that fuses real-world robot motion with synthetic visual data. It uses ROS2 to integrate a YOLOv8-based detection system and a ResNet50 network for precise distance estimation, enabling efficient testing of visual navigation algorithms across varied hardware and lighting conditions.
